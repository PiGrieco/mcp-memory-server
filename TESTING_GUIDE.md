# üß™ MCP Memory Server - Complete Testing Guide

**Test your intelligent memory system with these comprehensive prompts**

## üéØ **BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TESTS**

### **Test 1: System Status Check**
```
Use the memory_status tool to check the current system status
```
**Expected**: Shows mode (Simple/Full), memory count, working directory

### **Test 2: Save Your First Memory**
```
Save this to memory: "Today I successfully set up the MCP Memory Server for Cursor IDE. This is a breakthrough for intelligent AI conversations!"
```
**Expected**: Confirmation with memory ID

### **Test 3: List All Memories**
```
Use the list_memories tool to show all stored memories
```
**Expected**: Shows the memory you just saved

### **Test 4: Search for Memories**
```
Search for memories containing "MCP Memory Server"
```
**Expected**: Finds and returns the relevant memory

## üöÄ **ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY TESTS**

### **Test 5: Save Project Information**
```
Save this important project info to memory: "Project: E-commerce Platform. Tech Stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB. Team: 5 developers. Deadline: March 2025. Key features: user authentication, payment processing, inventory management."
```

### **Test 6: Save Development Decisions**
```
Save this decision to memory: "Architecture Decision: We chose microservices over monolithic architecture because of scalability requirements. Each service will have its own database. Using Docker for containerization."
```

### **Test 7: Save Meeting Notes**
```
Save this meeting summary to memory: "Sprint Planning Meeting - Jan 15, 2025: Decided to implement user authentication first, then payment gateway. John will handle frontend, Sarah backend. Estimated 2 weeks for completion."
```

### **Test 8: Complex Search Test**
```
Search for memories about "architecture" or "microservices"
```
**Expected**: Should find the architecture decision memory

### **Test 9: Project Context Search**
```
Search for memories related to "React" and "Node.js"
```
**Expected**: Should find the project information memory

### **Test 10: Team Information Search**
```
Search for memories containing team member names like "John" or "Sarah"
```
**Expected**: Should find the meeting notes

## üéØ **REAL-WORLD SCENARIO TESTS**

### **Scenario 1: Bug Tracking**
```
Save this bug report to memory: "BUG-001: Login form validation not working on Safari browser. Error occurs when user enters special characters in password field. Temporary workaround: use Chrome. Priority: High. Assigned to: Frontend team."
```

### **Scenario 2: Code Review Notes**
```
Save this code review to memory: "Code Review - Payment Module: Good error handling implementation. Suggested improvements: add input validation, implement rate limiting, add unit tests for edge cases. Overall: Approved with minor changes."
```

### **Scenario 3: Client Requirements**
```
Save this client feedback to memory: "Client Meeting - ABC Corp: Requested dark mode feature, mobile responsiveness improvements, and integration with their existing CRM system. Budget approved for additional 40 hours of development work."
```

### **Scenario 4: Search for Bug Information**
```
Search for memories about "bugs" or "errors"
```

### **Scenario 5: Find Client Requirements**
```
Search for memories containing "client" or "requirements"
```

## üîç **MEMORY PERSISTENCE TESTS**

### **Test 11: Memory Persistence Check**
1. Save several memories using the tests above
2. Close Cursor IDE completely
3. Restart Cursor IDE
4. Use `list_memories` to verify memories are still there

### **Test 12: Cross-Session Search**
After restarting Cursor:
```
Search for memories about "MCP Memory Server"
```
**Expected**: Should still find your first memory

## üìä **PERFORMANCE TESTS**

### **Test 13: Large Memory Storage**
```
Save this detailed memory: "Comprehensive Project Documentation: This is a large memory entry containing extensive project details including technical specifications, user requirements, system architecture diagrams, database schemas, API endpoints, security protocols, deployment procedures, testing strategies, performance benchmarks, scalability considerations, maintenance procedures, and future enhancement roadmap for the e-commerce platform project."
```

### **Test 14: Multiple Memory Search**
```
Search for memories containing "project"
```
**Expected**: Should find multiple relevant memories quickly

## üéØ **INTEGRATION TESTS**

### **Test 15: Development Workflow Test**
```
Save this workflow to memory: "Development Workflow: 1. Create feature branch, 2. Write tests first (TDD), 3. Implement feature, 4. Run all tests, 5. Code review, 6. Merge to main, 7. Deploy to staging, 8. QA testing, 9. Deploy to production."
```

### **Test 16: API Documentation**
```
Save this API info to memory: "API Endpoints: POST /api/auth/login (user authentication), GET /api/products (fetch products), POST /api/orders (create order), PUT /api/users/:id (update user profile). All endpoints require JWT token except login. Rate limit: 100 requests per minute."
```

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Your MCP Memory Server is working perfectly if:

- ‚úÖ All memories are saved successfully with unique IDs
- ‚úÖ Search finds relevant memories accurately
- ‚úÖ Memories persist across Cursor restarts
- ‚úÖ System status shows correct information
- ‚úÖ No errors or crashes during operations
- ‚úÖ Fast response times (under 1 second)

## üéâ **CONGRATULATIONS!**

If all tests pass, you now have a **fully functional intelligent memory system** that will:

- üß† **Remember everything** important from your conversations
- üîç **Find relevant context** instantly when needed
- üìä **Maintain project knowledge** across sessions
- ‚ö° **Enhance your productivity** with persistent AI memory

**Your Cursor IDE is now transformed into an intelligent, memory-powered development assistant!** üöÄ
